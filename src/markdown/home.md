You've discovered my website! It may not be much, but it's the start of a big project!

My name is Landon Faris, a senior computer engineering student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who has a passion for computer science and DevOps automation. I've been writing code ever since I was 5 years old and this website is meant to act as a testament to the wealth of knowledge and experience that I've acquired throughout my life.

I currently work as a DevOps intern at Rockwell Automation with 3 prior years of experience including 21 months (part-time school year included) as a full stack developer for an Agile team using a MEAN stack, a summer as an intern working under three managers creating various software tools while also gaining experience testing motor drives and PCBs, and a summer working on a software testing team improving a testing automation platform.

This website is fully self-hosted and uses a number of tools to maintain a robust and secure infrastructure.
- Running locally on a mini PC
- Machine configured as web server completely declaratively with NixOS
- DNS Routing through Cloudflare Zero Trust
- Express Node server running typescript that preprocesses page content using Handlebars and markdown


Here's a brief outlook for what else I plan to include here:
- Gitlab runners (on a private gitlab instance!)
- Ansible automation for server testing and deployment
- A blog like platform that can be updated without having to touch the server in any way
- Nixos configurations for quickly and deterministically deploying new infrastructure
- Containizered deployment of gitlab runners and redundant web servers
- Handling of subdomains for my various services
